# AMBIGUITY ✨
I wanted to create an ambiguous dimension where I research the idea of organic forms. To me, this is considered “world building” but with a broader concept. When we think about “world building,” we think about more literal ideas of city-scapes, landscapes, cyberpunk, utopian worlds, etc. I want to challenge this idea by creating a space where organic forms lie and there is more room for interpretation.

# ARTIST STATEMENT ✨
Being used to literal aspects of our everday lives, how would we interpret an abstract world with organic forms and matter? Allow yourselves to be one with space. Get lost in your own interpretation of reality. I created this with the intention to challenge space, time, and matter. What we see in our everyday lives is only the reality that we know of. What if there are alternate worlds beyond what we know?
